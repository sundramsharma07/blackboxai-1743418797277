# Build System Issues

## Current Problem
- Tailwind CLI fails with error: "could not determine executable to run"
- PostCSS direct execution also fails
- Binaries missing from node_modules/.bin despite proper installation

## Workaround (Verified)
- Using CDN for development (confirmed working)
  - Note: CDN shows warning about production use
  - All UI functionality confirmed working
- Production build still needs to be fixed
- Development workflow is functional
- Temporary solution only - must be addressed before production

## Investigation Needed
1. Node/npm version compatibility
2. Permission issues in node_modules
3. Possible corrupted package installations
4. Need to verify postcss-cli is installed
